### Project: ToDo List

### This project is done as part of the [Odin course](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)

You can do the following:

- Remove or add a new project
- View or hide all projects
- Add todos in different projects
- Expand a single todo to view or modify its details
- Delete a todo

In today's directory, there are duplicate tasks with today's date. Changing one of the todo's properties also changes the other one in a separate directory.
Using the Window localStorage object, your projects and to-do list will be saved in the local storage of your browser if you restart this application.
